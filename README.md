Hi everyone!

Today, we are so happy to announce a new VRC app: Team Builder.

Team Builder is full of unique features that work toward our goal of fostering easier connections in the world of robotics, whether that be from person to person, team to team, or Event Partners to participating teams.

Team Builder’s beautiful user interface is designed for VRC, prioritizing information and connections, while minimizing distracting details. 

We have spent months perfecting every aspect of Team Builder so that, after a brief public beta, it will be available for Android and iOS at launch.

Below is a quick preview of some of the features in Team Builder:

⭐  Adaptive Match Schedules - Know if matches are running late or (rarely) fast, and see when you should leave and prepare for your match

⭐  Live activities on iOS - See live event details on the Lock Screen, Notification Center, and Dynamic Island on iOS

⭐  Alliance Chats - Chat with your alliance partners and other teams during events to strategize, communicate, and more

⭐  Voice & Video Calls - Call other teams without needing their phone numbers or contact information.

⭐  Match Predictions - Predict match outcomes, right from within the app, using a custom-built match prediction model that doesn't rely on past season data or other unreliable sources.

*Pre-release product described. Actual software may differ slightly.

We have many more features planned for the coming weeks! To check out more about the app, join our development server, and sign up for our public beta, visit https://team-builder.org/

Team Builder relies on you to create an amazing and interconnected experience. We can’t wait to see how you shape the future of VRC!
